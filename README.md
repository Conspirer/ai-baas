FastAPI is being used, a framework for handling HTTP requests.

Studied about @app.get, and how each is a request to that specific URL, or a "request", as we call it, is sent when we visit that specific URL. Then, the function below it is called. We can use {} to fetch the values in the url.

PostGRES is using SQL commands. That is our primary database being used. Servers are stateless in their own python code.
